(Html, CSS, JS Modules, jQuery) Project. Single page application using ECMAScript Modules, jQuery and other small libraries( easyPaginate.js and awesompletete.js).
The app is using  Firebase for storing and calling data. 
I have restricted other users to write data on my database, so you can only get data.
