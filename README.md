# Project-Module2-Telerik
Telerik Academy - Module 2 (Html, CSS, JS Modules, jQuery) Project. Single page application using ECMAScript Modules, jQuery and other small libraries( easyPaginate.js and awesompletete.js).

The app is using  Firebase for storing and calling data. I have restricted other users to write data on my database, so you can only get data. In order to test the app to its full extent, create your own database and change the database link in database-service.js.
This project is done in collaboration with https://github.com/vtsvetanova and https://github.com/bpopnikolov
